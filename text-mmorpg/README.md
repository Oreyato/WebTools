### Little experimentations using webtools

#### Used tools
- MongoDBCompass
- Postman

If you installed MongoDB using scoop, you will need to run this command in PowerShell in order to use MongoDBCompass:
```
mongod -dbpath path_to_scoop_folder\apps\mongodb\6.1.0\data\
```

To start the server, run this command in VSCode terminal:
```
npm run dev
```
